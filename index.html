            I wanted to log some of the strange things I have been experiencing lately. Specifically, the closed off
            bridge. That one with the lamp post and bench that cant be accessed most of the year. I wanted to tell you
            the next time I see you in person but with how things are currently going I dont know if that is going to
            happen. I hope you are doing well though. It getting darker this time of year and unlike the summer, I want
            to understand exactly what I saw. It haunts me every time I go on a walk and see it. The bridge.

            Last weekend I decided to go walk by the bridge again. I wanted to see if I could get a closer look since
            the incident. I noticed it was fenced off this time. Only in late evenings and early mornings its back open
            again. But its odd. Nobody really goes to the spot where it happened. I asked an friend who lived up here if
            it was normal for people to avoid the bridge at night. I myself am from a pretty busy city so every public
            park/path is always semi-busy at the very least. But this, its just dead silent some hours. And I dont just
            mean that nobody goes there. I mean there quite literally is no sound. No birds, no wind, no cars. Nothing.
            I dont know what to make of it. I want to go back and check it out some more. A little busy right now with
            school and other stuff but I will try to make time for it.
